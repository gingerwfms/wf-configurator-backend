Ginger Workflow Configurator Backend
------------------------------------

The [Ginger Workflow Management System](https://github.com/gingerwfms/ginger-wfms) is a module driven system.
Each part is an own ZF2 module, with an associated github repo, a composer package and a travis-ci build.
The gingerwfms/wf-configurator-backend provides the Workflow Configurator Domain, that handles the setup of 
workflows and the run configuration of each workflow.
